# gallery

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I created a gallery so when user click to an image, it becomes the background of the page. User can also be able to use left and right arrow to move between images. The page also has been set with media queries so it will adapt to different screen sizes. All images also have 'alt' attributes.
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I wanted to create the outline on each image using :focus but after couple of hours play around and doing researches, I still not be able to do it. Also, I wanted to use the 'Tab' key to move between images but I was unable to do it. I understand that I need to do something with 'tabindex' but still could not figure out the way. If possible, please can I have the answer on these part.
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
JavaScript was the part I struggled with. Heinry helped me alot on this bit.
